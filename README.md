A movie recommender system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a type of collaborative filtering algorithm that recommends movies based on users' ratings of other movies. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. Data Collection
To start, the system needs a dataset of movie ratings. This could be a matrix where rows represent users and columns represent movies, and each cell contains a rating given by a user to a movie.

2. Preprocessing
The data might need preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize ratings, and remove outliers. This ensures the quality and accuracy of recommendations.

3. Defining the Distance Metric
KNN is a distance-based algorithm. You need to define a distance metric to calculate the similarity between users or items. Common choices are Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

4. Finding Neighbors
For a given user, the algorithm finds the k most similar users (neighbors) based on the distance metric. These neighbors have similar tastes and preferences.

5. Aggregating Ratings
The system aggregates the ratings of the neighbors to generate a recommendation. This can be done by averaging the ratings of the k neighbors or using weighted averages, where closer neighbors have more influence.

6. Making Recommendations
Based on the aggregated ratings, the system recommends movies that the target user has not yet rated but are highly rated by their neighbors.
